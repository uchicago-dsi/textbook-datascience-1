    "# Simple Linear Regression\n",

    "*Bill Trok*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will begin discussion of some of the more advanced techniques in Data Science. Frequently, we are interested not just in the behavior of a variable, but how that variable behaves as another variable changes. We've seen this already in the form of A/B testing, this lets us see how one variable varies as a binary variable changes. Here we extend this seeing how a change in one numeric variable affects another.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a simple linear regression will not allow us to model all possible relationships between two numeric variables it's simplicity and interpretability still make it a valuable tool, when working with data. "
