    "So far, we have seen that Python can evaluate mathematical expressions, but we haven't used a equal sign. Python's equal sign (`=`) has different behavior for different data types. Some data types are **immutable** meaning that they can't be changed or edited. Others are **mutable** and can be changed or edited. Mutable data types are more complicated and we will talk about them more in the [next chapter](../../04/4/assignment.ipynb). Immutable data types include integers, floats, booleans, strings (covered in the [next section](../4/Strings.ipynb)), and tuples (covered in the [next chapter](add link when we have it)). \n",
