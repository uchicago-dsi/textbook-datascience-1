    "# Built-In Functions and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in functions are, as the name implies, already a part of the Python library. These are functions that are so commonly used that you just need to *call* them in order to use them yourself! We have already seen a few examples of built-in functions including  ```print()``` and ```type()```. There are some mathematical built-in functions, for example we can find the maximum or minimum of given numbers, or the absolute value of a single number. We can even round floating point numbers to a specified decimal. Additionally, there are functions that give us general information about the input, such as the length of a string or the type of the input object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To call a built-in function, we use the function name with parentheses around the function input. For example the function name for maximum is ```max()``` and calling this function takes the format below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "max(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Functions take arguments as input, and if we are unsure what arguments a function accepts, there's a built-in function for that! The ```help()``` function. This function accepts a function as input and outputs the key characteristics, namely what it takes as input and what it outputs. Calling the ```help``` function on ```max```, we see we can enter two or more arguments and we expect the largest argument to be returned. We can alternately enter an iterable argument, like a sequence, discussed in detail in [Chapter 4: Data Structures](../../../04/DataStructures.ipynb)."
