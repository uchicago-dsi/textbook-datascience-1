    "Instead of writing a line of code multiple times to perform some action more than once, it might be advantageous to check if Python has a built-in function that already does what we want! If not, we can create our own **functions** in Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "Both functions built-in to Python and those user-created follow the general format of mathematical functions of which you may be familiar. For example, the mathematical function f(x) = x + 2 takes an input, x, and returns x plus 2. Python functions work similarly.  They require an input, called an **argument**, to the function, and they provide or compute some output. This section covers the foundations behind using built-in functions and how to create our own. Additionally, we consider **methods** in this section, which is a category of functions that pertain to a specific object, or type."
