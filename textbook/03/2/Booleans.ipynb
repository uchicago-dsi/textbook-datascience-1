    "Booleans are a data type that consist of two possible outcomes: `True` or `False`. Under the hood, these values take on a binary value, where `True` is equal to 1 and `False` is equal to 0. Booleans are very commonly used with comparison operators (discussed more in [Section 3.4](../../03/4/Comparison.ipynb)), and because they also can have a numeric meaning, they can be used in calculations as well. Let's start with a simple example of a Boolean."
