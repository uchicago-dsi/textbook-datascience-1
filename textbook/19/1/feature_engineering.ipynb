    "Datasets in machine learning can broadly be categorized as structured and unstructured, depending on its format of presentation:\n",
    "- **Structured data**: Structured data is typically stored in tabular formats with a well-defined schema that every single row or datapoint adheres to when being recorded. Structured data can include both quantitative measurements (prices, height, etc.) as well as qualitative records (dates, names, addresses, etc.) This kind of data works well with most machine learning algorithms, can be easy to maintain and interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example of structured data : Below is a dataset that we have previously used for data analysis. It contains information on different houses in Athens, Ohio. Every record indicates the relationship between the various features of a residence listed in this data and the price at which it was sold in the market. The data is structured because every record is represented using the same set of attributes."

    "- **Scaling/Normalization**: \n",
    "Feature Scaling is an important problem to tackle when feeding numeric data to models. In order to train a model and enhance its predictive capacity features should preferably be within a similar range and not vastly disparate scales. Min-max normalization is a common way of feature scaling where all values are scaled down to a range between [0, 1]. The resulting transformation has no influence on the feature's underlying distribution but could be sensitive to the presence of outliers that could affect the minimum and maximum feature values and as a result the underlying scale. To put this in a formula, scaling for feature $x$ is conducted as follows:\n",

    "Another approach to normalize data is Standardization or z-score normalization, that takes into account the underlying variance of the feature distribution. To standardize a feature column, all data points are subtracted by their mean value and the result divided by the feature distribution's standard deviation. The transformed data points represent z-scores of the initial feature values. Recall that we have explored this concept previously in [Section 17.2](../../17/2/correlation.ipynb). To put this in a formula, the standardization of feature $x$ with mean value $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ is conducted as follows:\n",

Since the standardization process does not limit the transformed values within a specific range, the outliers within data do not impact the transformation process. However it does enforce the assumption that the feature is normally distributed which may not always be true.\n",

Although we have previously implemented a function `standard_units` in [Section 17.2](../../17/2/correlation.ipynb) to convert feature values to their corresponding z-scores, we can alternatively use the `StandardScaler` to do the same."

Instead, we first split our data into training and test sets and apply `MinMaxScaler().fit_transform` or `StandardScaler().fit_transform` on the training set and the corresponding `transform` function on the test set. This is done to obtain the appropriate scale in which feature values are to be normalized, or in the case of standardization, the mean and variance of the feature distribution from the training split.\n",

    "This is aligned with an important principle of machine learning that training data is the only information that is available and should be used to learn model parameters. Or else, fitting the `MinMaxScaler` or `StandardScaler` on the test data leads to data leakage where information from the test set inadverdently influences the training process by projecting over-optimistic performance estimates.\n",

    "Often features represent raw counts or frequencies whose exact values are less relevant to the problem at hand. Instead, the prediction task might only need to rely on the feature for being indicative of a certain phenomenon in the data space. In such cases, binarization of a numeric feature can resolve the scaling issue, that we have navigated using previous techniques, by transforming the original feature to an indicator function. This also simplifies the learning problem by significantly reducing the range of values that the underlying model has to deal with during training.\n",

    "    In the following code, we apply binarization to the *Pregnancies* column, which indiciates the number of pregnanices that each subject in the dataset has experienced, and simplify the information in a binary feature 'was_pregnant' to indicate whether a subject has prior experience of carrying a child."

Although tree-based models (to be covered in [Chapter 25](../../25/placeholder25.ipynb)) are capable of handling raw categorical data, majority of models require numeric predictors as input. Hence, in this section, we will look into a few strategies we can utilize to engineer model-friendly features from categorical data."

    "The simplest way to handle categorical data is to create a vector of **indicator variables**, one for each category. These are variables artificially added to the feature set to capture the presence of different possible values for a categorical feature. To illustrate this consider the categorical feature *'race/ethnicity'* in the student scores dataset. We look into the possible values and convert them into dummy binary variables. It is also acceptable to create these dummy variables for all but one of the values. The reason to leave one of the values out is that it can be directly inferred from the states of the other variables. Including dummy variables for every single value a categotical feature takes could therefore add multicollinearity. In the following code, we use the `get_dummies` function from the Pandas library to accomplish this. The newly created variables are appended to the dataset thereby increasing the number of columns.  \n",

    "A drawback of the one-hot encoding setup is when the set of possible values for a categorical feature gets too large. For example encoding a categorical feature like ZIP code for United States could consist of up to 41K values. Applying the one-hot encoding strategy would lead to an overabundance of dummy variables relative to the number of datapoints available for effective model training. Moreover, due to uneven distribution of population across different locations, one might encounter certain zip codes much more frequently than others, leading to a long tailed feature distribution when collecting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "An issue with having such long-tailed feature distribution is that resampling the data might altogether exclude some infrequent categories from the analysis altogether. This could lead to dummy variable columns of all zeros and result in a numerical error for many models rendering them incapable of producing accurate predictions for test samples that do contain these categories. Feature columns with a single value are called zero-variance predictors that do not provide meaningful representation for the predictive task at hand. While we can create the full set of indicator variables and filter out those showing near-zero variance, the latter cannot be known a priori. As an alternative, these predictors can be pooled together to an \"Other\" category. Another way to combine categories would be to use a hash function and group categories into a reduced set of hashes."

When categories have a natural ordering among them, a numerical mapping of categories to values that preserves the same ordering makes sense and would also improve the underlying predictive task. Hence, such an ordering is called an Ordinal Encoding. Like label encoding, the data dimensionality is not increased during such transformations."

    "## Feature Engineering on Unstructured Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data practitioners often have to deal with data containing textual fields or unstructured text data for certain learning tasks. Data containing textual fields can be gathered from questionnaires, reviews, tweets or large-scale collection of documents otherwise called **corpus** (for example, collection of Shakespearean sonnets). For these datasets, words or phrases (sequence of consecutive words known as *n-grams*) populating the open text fields act as predictors for the machine learning task at hand. Hence, we need to find a process that transforms their absence or presence into a numerical representation of such textual data. This technique is referred to as **Text Vectorization**. Prior to this, data practitioners conduct a handful of text pre-processing and cleaning steps. These consist of:\n",
    "- Text Normalization: Case folding along with removal of punctuations or special characters\n",
    "- Tokenization: Segregating textual data into individual tokens, i.e, surface forms in which they appear in the text. \n",
    "- Stemming or lemmatization: Transforming tokens obtained in the previous step, i.e. the full inflected forms in which words appear in text, to their root forms, often by dropping suffixes. For example, the token *'jumping'* will be converted to the root word *'jump'*.\n",
    "- Removal of stopwords: Stopwords are functional words (like common prepositions or conjunctions) that appear frequently in text across all contexts and are therefore not considered to be discriminative features. Including these stopwords in text analysis brings in noise and skews the frequency distributions associated with words or tokens in your text data. Hence, it is important to remove them.\n",
    " \n",
    "Text Vectorization begins with setting a vocabulary, $V$, that comprises of all the possible distinct words encountered in a text corpus. Next we explore strategies that convert text data into $|V|$ dimensional vectors of binary or real-valued features. To understand these better, let us start with a simple example of a mini document collection."

Moving forward, we will see how the documents in the corpus are represented, using the 8 words in the vocabulary as features, in different text vectorization techniques."

    "The simplest vectorization technique is to treat the words in the vocabulary as categorical features and to associate an indicator variable with each word in the feature vector. However, one-hot encoding can only signify the presence or absence of certain words in text. In many text applications, frequency of words play an important role in measuring their relative importance within the corpus, as well as, to the predictive task at hand, which is why we often prefer alternative strategies.\n",

    "In the following code, we demonstrate how a document in the corpus above can be representated via one hot encoding in the `one_hot_encode` function. First we need to assign each word in the vocabulary an unique integer id between 0 and $|V|-1$. Each word in this representation is denoted using a vector of size $|V|$ containing all zeros except for the index that corresponds to the id of the word. A document in this representation is a collection of these one hot vectors, one for each token that can be found in the vocabulary."

    "#### Bag of Words representation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a popular representation of text data frequently utilized in the field of Information Retrieval. In bag-of-words models the input text is converted into a $|V|$ dimensional real-valued vector of word counts or frequencies. Bag-of-word (BOW) representation converts a text document into a flat vector. While we can encode the relative importance of words within a corpus through frequency features, this representation treat text data as an unordered collection of tokens. Since the ordering of words in text indicate both meaning and context, bag-of-words representation cannot encode any semantic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code we demonstrate how we can represent documents in a corpus as a bag, i.e. unordered collection, of words. We use `CountVectorizer` from the `sklearn` package to convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts. Each column in the matrix represents a token in the vocabulary while each column represents a document, contents of $i$-th row and $j$-th column shows the frequency of the word in column $j$ in document $i$. In the following output, the entry from row 3 and column 0 shows that the word *darkness* appears twice in the last document of our example corpus.\n"

It assumes that much like stopwords, if a word in a corpus appears widely in most or all document, it's informativeness relative to the content of individual documents is diminished. Rare words are considered more interesting since they can provide distinctive information. Hence, $idf$ applies a log transform upon the inverse of a word's document frequency. If in a corpus of $N$ documents, the word $w$ appears in $df(w)$ documents, then $idf(w,D) = log(\\frac{N}{df(w)})$.\n",
