## DataFrame
A data structure in Python provided by the `pandas` library for data analysis and manipulation. 

## Dimensions of a DataFrame
The number of rows $\times$ the number of columns

## Feature
A feature is a column in a DataFrame that represents a variable associated with each datapoint (row).

## Homogenous
Homogeneous means that all elements in a collection share the same data type.

## CSV
`.csv` is a file format (Comma-Separated Values) used to store tabular data in plain text, with each row as a line and columns separated by commas.

## Absolute File Path
Starts from the root of your computer and specifies the complete location of a file. For example, `/Users/<username>/Documents/data.csv`.

## Relative File Path
Starts from the folder where your notebook or script is located and specifies the file’s location relative to that folder. For example, `../data.csv`.

## RangeIndex
