## Estimation
A term used to describe learning about a population characteristic from a sample.

## Parameter
A numerical characteristic of a population, denoted by $\theta$.

## Confidence Interval
An interval which captures a plausible range of values for the true population parameter.

## Percentile Bootstrap Confidence Interval
A method for calculating a confidence interval by bootstrapping from the original sample.  The statistic of interest (say, the mean) is calculated from each bootstrapped sample. The distribution of sample means is then used to calculate the empirical percentiles of the lower and upper bound of the desired confidence interval.
