    "\n",
    "Assume, as in the previous section, that we have a population parameter of interest $\\theta$, and an estimate based on a sample of $n$ observations, $\\hat\\theta$. We also assume that the sampling distribution of $(\\hat\\theta-\\theta)$ is known. In the next section, we will show a method for obtaining an approximation to this sampling distribution.\n",

    "We define $L_0$ to be the 1% percentile of this distribution (that is 1% of of the distribution lies below $L_0$), and $U_0$ to be the 99% percentile.\n",

    "- The ends of the interval depend on the percentiles but also on the data (through $\\hat\\theta$) and are random (different samples result in different confidence intervals).\n",
    "- The probability statement we made was about the distribution of $(\\hat\\theta-\\theta)$.\n",
    "- About 98\\% of the intervals constructed like this will cover the true population parameter $\\theta$.\n",
    "- If we change the percentiles we get intervals with different confidence. For example, if $L_0$ is the 5% percentile and $U_0$ is 95% percentile, we will obtain a 90% confidence interval."

    "We illustrate the above concepts with a simple example where the sampling distribution is known. Assume we sample 4 independent observations from a normal population with mean equal to -2 and standard deviation equal to 1. The parameter of interest is the population mean ($\\theta=-2$). It is known from probability theory that sampling distribution of the sample mean is N(-2,1/2) and this allows us to obtain the sampling distribution for $(\\hat\\theta-\\theta)$, N(0,1/2), and its percentiles of interest. Below is the code that generates 90% confidence intervals. Note that to calculate percentiles of the normal distribution we use the `norm.ppf` function from the `scipy` library - this function requires us to specify the mean (location) and standard deviation (scale) of the normal distribution of interest."
