## If Statement
A control statement of the form of an "if-then": *if* statement `P`, the hypothesis, occurs, *then* statement `Q`, the conclusion, also occurs. This conditional statement follows the general format;

```python
if hypothesis_1:
    conclusion_1
elif hypothesis_2:
    conclusion_2
... 
elif hypothesis_n:
    conclusion_n
else:
    conclusion    
``` 

## For Statement
A control statement which allows for *iteration* through a sequence to perform some action on each of its elements. This sequence can be any *iterable* object, including a list, a string, or a range of numbers, to name a few. The general form of a `for` statement is below:

```python
for item in sequence:
    action    
```

## While Statement
In control statement which allows for repeated execution of an action *as long as*, or *while* a specific condition is true.  
The general format of a `while` loop is below.

```python
