## Birthday Problem
In a group of $n$ people, what is the probability that at least two of them share the same birthday?

## Random Phenomenon
A phenomenon where individual outcomes are uncertain. 

## Sample Space
The set of all possible outcomes of a random phenomenon. 

## Event
A set of outcomes of a random phenomenon.

## Mutually Exclusive Events
Events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive (or disjoint) if they have no outcomes in common.

## Disjoint Events
Events $A$ and $B$ are disjoint (or mutually exclusive) if they have no outcomes in common.

## Complement of an Event
The complement of an event $A$ is the event that $A$ does not occur.

## Compound Events
A  compound event is an event built from combinations of other events.

## Union of Events
Union of events $A$ and $B$ is the set of all outcomes in $A$, or in $B$, or in both.

## Intersection of Events
Intersection of events $A$ and $B$ is the set of all outcomes that are in $A$ and in $B$.

## Probability
Probability is a numerical measure of how likely an event is to occur, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).

## Conditional Probability
Conditional probability is the probability that an event occurs given that another event has already occurred.

## Multiplication Rule
$$\text{P}(A \text{ and } B) = \text{P}(A|B) \text{P}(B)$$

## Independent events
Independent events are two or more events where the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the others.

## Bayes' Theorem
$$\text{P}(A|B)  = \frac{\text{P}(B|A) \text{P}(A)}{\text{P}(B)}$$

### Triplets Problem
What is the probability that at least three people in a group of $n$ people share the same birthday?
