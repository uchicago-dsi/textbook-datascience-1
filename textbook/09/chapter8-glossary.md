## Numerical Data
Data represented by numbers. Can be discrete (counts) or continuous (measurements).
Examples: age, height, test scores.  

## Categorical Data
Data that falls into groups or categories. Values are usually labels, not numbers.
Examples: eye color, city of residence, type of car.  

## Histogram
A graph that shows the distribution of numerical data by grouping values into bins (intervals) and counting how many fall into each.  

## Scatter Plot
A graph of points showing the relationship between two numerical variables. Each point represents one observation.  

## Line Graph
A graph where data points are connected by lines, often used to show change over time.

## Pie Graph
A circular chart divided into slices, where each slice represents a proportion of the whole.  

## Bar Graph
A chart that uses rectangular bars to compare values across categories. Bars can be vertical or horizontal.  

## Distribution
The way values of a variable are spread out. For example, a distribution might be normal (bell-shaped), skewed, or uniform.

## Ordinal Data
A type of categorical data where the categories have a natural order or ranking, but differences between ranks are not necessarily meaningful.  
Example: small, medium, large.

## Nominal Data
Categorical data with no inherent order.  
Example: red, green, blue; or dog, cat, bird.

## Boxplot
A graphical summary of a distribution that shows the median, quartiles, and possible outliers. Also called a box-and-whisker plot.

## Quartile
One of four equal parts of ordered data. Q1 is the 25th percentile, Q2 is the median (50th percentile), Q3 is the 75th percentile.

## Interquartile Range
The range between the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3). Represents the middle 50% of the data.  
$$
IQR = Q3 - Q1
$$

## Mean
The arithmetic average.  
$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}}
$$

## Median
The middle value when data is ordered. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

## Outlier
A value much higher or lower than the rest of the data. Outliers can strongly influence statistics like the mean.
