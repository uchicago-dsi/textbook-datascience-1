## Association
An association between two variables implies a pattern that can help us make inferences on one variable given information about the other.

## Causality
A quantifiable relationship between two variables where a change in one directly causes a change in the other.

## Confounding Variable
In the context of measuring the causal effect of one variable on another, a confounding variable or confounder is a third variable (an external factor) that affects both the independent variable (probable cause) and dependent variable (probabale effect). When the confounder is not factored in correctly, a study can lead to drawing incorrect conclusion regarding the causal relationship of the independent variable on the dependent one.

## Conditioning
Conditioning for a confounding variable requires experimentors to statistically adjust its influence to correctly measure the causal effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable. Conditioning for a confounding variable can be done using techniques like randomization. This involves keeping the value of the confounding variable a constant across subjects and then randomly dividing into two groups that are identical in all but the independent variable in question.

## Colliding Variable
When two variables have a causal impact on the same variable, the latter is called a collider or a colliding variable.

## Experimental Studies
A study setup where researchers selectively impose a treatment on a specific population to observe resulting outcomes and estimate its causal linkage to that is called an experimental study.

## Control Groups
The group receiving no treatment, i.e. in placebo, within an experimental study is called the control group.

## Randomization
Randomization is the process of assigning experimental subjects randomly to different groups such that the group are comparable in every aspect other than whether or not they receive the treatment. This is done to estimate the causal effect of the treatment on a specific outcome under question.

## Observational Studies
In observational studies, you are just given a dataset that is a collection of observations passively reflecting the state of a subset of the population vis a vis some specific outcome being studied. Observational data and inferential stats can answer many interesting questions but not discover causal relationships between independent variables and the outcome.

## Population
A population is an entire group of subject upon which an experimental or observational study is conducted.

## Sampling
The process of selecting a representative subset from the population of a study for analyzing specific phenomena.

## Simple Random Sampling
Simple Random Sampling is a technique to randomly select samples from a population of interest such that each member is equally likely to be included in the sample.

## Stratified Random Sampling
Stratified Random Sampling involves dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups or strata such that the subsequent sample is formed by drawing simple random sample from within each strata.

## Cluster Sampling
Much like stratified random sampling, the population for cluster sampling also consists of clusters or subgroups. In this case, the sample is formed by drawing a simple random of these clusters.

## Multistage Sampling
Multistage sampling is a method that involves a series of sampling steps to select a random sample from a population by breaking it down into smaller and smaller groups.

## Biased Sampling
Biased sampling occurs when the complete frame of the population is not utilized to draw samples.

## Bias
Bias refers to systemic errors in a study that are caused by skewed representation of certain subgroups within its population of interest and can distort its findings.

## Selection Bias
Selection bias occurs when some groups within a population are disproportionately represented in a sample over the rest thereby leading to misleading generalizations.

## Response Bias
Response bias appears when participants in self-reported surveys or studies respond to questions in an inaccurate manner rather than with the truth.

## Non response Bias
Non response bias appears when some participants in a self-reported survey or study decline to respond to questions and they are also meaningfully different from the subset of the population whose responses are available.

## Randomized Response
Randomized response is a technique to conduct statistical research. This process allows researchers to gather sensitive information in a manner that introduces randomness to the survey response process, thereby preserving respondent privacy.

## Survivorship Bias
Survivorship bias appears with the overrepresentation of responses from participants who remained (or 'survived') within the purview of a study or survey long-term while ignoring those who dropped out.

## Undercoverage Bias
Undercoverage bias appears when drawing participants from an incomplete sampling frame that leaves out significant sections of the population of interest.
