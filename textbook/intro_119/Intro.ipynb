    "Part-1 of this textbook introduced you to the exciting field of Data Science and equipped you with the Mathematical, Statistical and programming tools to explore, clean, and understand data. In Part II, we take the next step: use data to build models that help us make predictions, identify patterns, and uncover hidden structure. This is where we formally step into the world of **machine learning**.\n",
