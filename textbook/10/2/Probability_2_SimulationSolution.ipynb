    "Recall that we have seen the concept of simulation in [Section 5.3](../../05/3/Control_Statements_Iteration.ipynb) (we simulated the output of rolling a six-sided die). Simulations are used to imitate real-world scenarios. They can serve many purposes, ranging from obtaining insight into physical systems to testing and training of models and algorithms. In this chapter, we will use simulations to estimate probabilities. We will explore other applications later, such as gaining insight into probability distributions.\n",

It turns out we have already seen a function in `numpy` that can do that: `random.choice`.\n",
