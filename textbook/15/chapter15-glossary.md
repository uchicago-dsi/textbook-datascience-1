## Benchmarking
A method used to compare observed proportions in a dataset to some external reference (the “benchmark”). In the context of data ethics and policing, benchmarking often compares the proportion of traffic stops for a group (e.g., by race) to that group’s proportion in the local driving population.  

- If the proportions are similar, this suggests no evidence of disproportionate treatment.  
- If the proportions are very different, this may indicate potential bias.
